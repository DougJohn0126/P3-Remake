Initially made before an official remake for Persona 3 was announced to the public in June 2023. All 3D models are from the 2019 spinoff P3 Dancing. Some animations are from Mixamo. Music, sound effects, and 2D avatars are from the original 2007 game. Combat UI, battle stance  & summoning animations, avatar rigs, and code were all developed by myself in Adobe Illustrator, Blender and Unity ver. 2020.3.17f1.

All rights belong to Atlus, the original creators of Persona 3.
